# Word Counter

## Project Summary

Word Counter is a clean, responsive web application designed to help users instantly analyze their text input. It provides real-time statistics including word count, character count (with and without spaces), sentence count, and line count. In addition to analytical features, it also offers helpful utilities such as converting text to uppercase, lowercase, capital case, sentence case, clearing the text, and copying to clipboard — all in a single, intuitive interface.

The primary goal of this project is to offer a lightweight, user-friendly tool for writers, editors, students, and professionals who frequently work with text and need to monitor or manipulate its structure. The app is built using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating how powerful simple web technologies can be when used effectively.

The application is fully responsive, ensuring optimal usability on both desktop and mobile devices. It also includes accessibility features like keyboard navigation and visible focus outlines. Every change in the text area is reflected immediately in the live statistics display, making the experience seamless and interactive.
